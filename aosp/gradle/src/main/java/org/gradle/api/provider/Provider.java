/**
 * A container object that provides a value of a specific type. The value can be retrieved by the method {@link #get()} or {@link #getOrNull()}.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A provider may not always have a value available, for example when the value may not yet be known but will be known at some point in the future.
 * When a value is not available, {@link #isPresent()} returns {@code false} and retrieving the value will fail with an exception.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A provider may not always provide the same value. Although there are no methods on this interface to change the value,
 * the provider implementation may be mutable or use values from some changing source.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A provider may provide a value that is mutable and that changes over time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A typical use of a provider is to pass values from one DSL element to another, e.g. from an extension to a task.
 * Providers also allow expensive computations to be deferred until their value is actually needed, usually at task execution time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * For a provider whose value can be mutated, see {@link Property}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Do not use <code>Provider&lt;File&gt;</code>. Use {@link org.gradle.api.file.Directory} or {@link org.gradle.api.file.RegularFile} instead.
 * </p>
