  Compare Two Java short Arrays Example

      To compare two short arrays use,
      static boolean equals(short array1[], short array2[]) method of Arrays class.

      It returns true if both arrays are equal. Arrays are considered as equal
      if they contain same elements in same order.

 Output of the program would be
 Are two short arrays equal ? : true
